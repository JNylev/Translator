J-unit tests:
The first test failed 50%

Most errors are from loops that are based around having a large word pool (with variating sizes). It now has escape functions in situations where very few pairs are added.
Our add function cleared the ArrayList to easier add smaller bits, but this part was moved to the GUI.



The last J-unit test:
We hit 100% - the major improvement after the first test was the filename. We had it hardcoded and overwritten several places. Now it will overwrite, but only with function given commands.
Also removed an instance where "question" was able to return null in a large while loop, why is still a mystery since the getQuestion(getDanishWord) method worked flawlessly.
